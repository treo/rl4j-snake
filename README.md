# Snake reinforcement learning

This repository contains a simple snake game, and a setup to for an RL agent to learn how to play it. 

This uses RL4J and a hilariously bad swing UI to show the game state. Do not consider anything you see here to be good practice. 

Note:
* The agents aren't properly tuned
* The A3C algorithm crashes the JVM

**Use this at your own risk.**
